A repository for an app to download YouTube videos easily and flawlessly, made in Visual Studio. Don’t trust the exe? You can download the project files and compile it in Visual Studio yourself. I made this because I got tired of downloading videos from sketchy sites and I know other people are tired of it too. This app is completely free, you can use it for whatever you want, but it doesn’t fall on me. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a scammer. Enjoy.
